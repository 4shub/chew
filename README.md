Chew

Source code for a small project I made on request. If you want to test it out go here: http://trychew.com/

Details
==
Chew was built in a few hours under some rush (you can see some of it in the code). The code is a bit sloppy but it should provide some people with better insights into build a platform with Stripe and Twitter integration.

Use this for education or for your own projects. Try it out here by the way:

Have fun, <br>
